# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site with an accordion, styling, and header.

## The problem

We chose a header picture and started from there.
We had problems with creating space between the labels in the form.
And to make the header picture be fixed and not scroll.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
